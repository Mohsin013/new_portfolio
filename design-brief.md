# Design Brief: Mohsin Iqbal Portfolio

**Role:** Founding Engineer & AI Systems Architect
**Concept:** "Exclusive Personal Operating System"
**Aesthetic:** Apple Vision Pro × Linear × Future OS

## Core Objectives
1.  **Establish Authority:** Move beyond "hired gun" developer vibes. Establish Mohsin as a builder of entire systems who takes ownership.
2.  **Highlight Depth:** Showcase specific architectures (AWS, AI Agents, WebRTC, Heartbeat Sync) rather than generic skill lists.
3.  **Cinematic Experience:** The site must feel like software, not a document. Use dark mode, glassmorphism, and subtle kinetic physics.

## Visual Language
*   **Palette:** Deep Charcoal (`#0A0A0A`), Electric Blue (`#3B82F6`), Neon Purple (`#8B5CF6`).
*   **Typography:** 
    *   *Headlines:* Inter (Tight tracking, high contrast).
    *   *Micro-copy:* JetBrains Mono (Technical, code-like, uppercase).
*   **Texture:** Noise overlays, blurred gradients (`backdrop-blur-md`), faint grid lines (`border-white/5`).

## Key Interactions
1.  **Boot Sequence:** The site loads like a system booting up. Elements fade in with a slight vertical slide.
2.  **Node Network:** The hero section features a canvas-based particle network representing distributed systems.
3.  **Kinetic Cards:** "What I Build" cards react to mouse position or hover with smooth easing.
4.  **Sticky Exhibits:** Project details remain fixed while the user scrolls through architectural diagrams.

## Success Metrics
*   Visitor spends >2 minutes engaging with case studies.
*   "Initiate Contact" feels like a premium call to action.
*   Performance (Lighthouse) score > 95 despite heavy visuals.
